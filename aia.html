          <h4>Why am I interested in working with App Inventor?</h4>
          <p>A few years ago I was a very inexperienced programmer that wanted to do one thing: make Android apps. The skills I gained from using App Inventor enabled me to develop Triton Bites, my first Android application. I owe a lot to App Inventor's guidance and I would love to help make App Inventor even better for future developers.</p>
          <h4>Interest in introductory programming</h4>
          <p> During my stint as a Tech Mentor at my local library, kids would come up occasionally asking me how to make a website, a game, an app, or just help on their programming assignment. Of course I taught them the steps to achieve what they wanted and I linked them to App Inventor if they wanted to learn how to make an app. They would come back every few weeks with their progress and show me what they made which always made me smile and proud of their work.</p>
          <h4>Proposed Summer Project</h4>
          <p>The Google Cardboard SDK is what I would love to work on this summer. I recently received a Google Cardboard from a promotion by Conan O'Brien and I have been obsessed with it ever since. Seeing the smile on everyone I showed its capabilities to showed me the magic of VR. By making it easier to make applications for Cardboard, we can push the boundaries of what Cardboard can do.</p>
          <h4>Experience with the development tools</h4>
          <h4>Challenge 1</h4>
          <p>I made a simple voice activated app using App Inventor where you can simple press Ask Watson and ask your question. If he does not know, then he will ask you if you would like to ask Google. Try asking arithmetic questions!</p>
